Amrith is the topper of his class. He is always ahead of the syllabus. Therefore Amrith often feels bored during classes. During an Algorithm lecture at his college, the professor gives him a question to be solved. The professor gives him a valid mathematical expression consisting of variables, round parantheses ( '(' and ')' ), addition operator ('+') and subtraction operator ('-'). The professor asks him to obtain another valid mathematical expression consisting of variables, addition operator ('+') and subtraction operator ('-') only which has the same mathematical value as the initial mathematical expression conntaining round parantheses. The only constraint on the obtained/generated mathematical expression is that every variable in the expression must be preceeded by an addition operator ('-') or a subtraction operator ('-'). Anish, one of Amrith's classmate, wants to prove that he is as brilliant as Amrith and asks Amrith for the problem. Can you help Anish solve the problem?
